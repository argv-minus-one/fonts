Occasionally I hack on some [simple] fonts, or just collect nice ones before
they disappear from the Net.  So far here we have:

- vgafonts: cute and/or bizarre bitmap fonts (Latin only)
- extended version of Apple's classic bitmap Chicago by Susan Kare

    Being a big fan of Chicago font, I was dissatisfied with how its later
    B&H's TrueType version was rasterized in X11.  Original bitmap version
    was what I needed, but it was vastly incomplete -- most importantly,
    lacking Cyrillic glyphs and many other useful symbols.

    This work is an attempt to extend original bitmap Chicago, while trying
    to preserve its original cuteness and philosophy.
